# Dania's Blocklist
My custom blocklist that used to focus primarily on blocking  annoying popups on Bunkr that Brave doesn't block on mobile. However, it now also includes some other visual stuff/advertisement/annoyance blocks for other NSFW sites. It is created using uBlock Origin in Chromium/Brave.

> [!WARNING]
> While this blocklist *should* work alone, it's made to be combined with the defualt selection of uBO blocklists. It is therefore **NOT** recommended to use this blocklist as a standalone.

> [!NOTE]
> Documents, including a code of conduct, a contributing guide, security, and a pull request template, are available [here](https://github.com/zDania4/blocklist/tree/main/docs) or [here](https://zdania4.github.io/blocklist/docs/).

> [!CAUTION]
> While it is doesn't happen often, some websites **will** eventually break when updated and can in the worst case lead to ads/popups showing up. If you come across a broken website, please create a bug report under Issues.
