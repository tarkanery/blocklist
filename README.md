# Dania's Blocklist
My custom blocklist. It focuses primarily on blocking the annoying popups on Bunkr, that isn't blocked by Brave on mobile, but it also includes some other visual stuff/advertisement/annoyance blocks - both for Bunkr and for some other NSFW sites. It's created using uBlock Origin in Chromium/Brave.

It should work with most adblockers, but I've only tested it using uBlock Origin (PC) and Brave for iOS. You can add the list using the following URL:

And, just as a fair warning, it'll very likely be broken within a week since the last update, as Bunkr updates its popup domains pretty often.
