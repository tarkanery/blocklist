# Dania's Blocklist
My custom blocklist. It focuses primarily on blocking the annoying popups on Bunkr that Brave doesn't block on mobile. However, it also includes some other visual stuff/advertisement/annoyance blocks for Bunkr and some other NSFW sites. It is created using uBlock Origin in Chromium/Brave.

It should work with most adblockers, but I've only tested it using uBlock Origin (PC) and Brave for iOS. You can add the list using one of the following URLs:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zDania4/blocklist/main/filter.txt, https://zdania4.github.io/blocklist/filter.txt or by [clicking here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zDania4/blocklist/main/filter.txt) or [here](https://zdania4.github.io/blocklist/filter.txt).

Documents, including a code of conduct, a contributing guide, security, and a pull request template, are available [here](https://github.com/zDania4/blocklist/tree/main/docs) or [here](https://zdania4.github.io/blocklist/docs/).
 
And, just as a fair warning, it'll likely be broken within a week since the last update, as Bunkr updates its popup domains pretty often.
