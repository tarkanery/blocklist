# blocklist
My custom blocklist. It focuses primarily on blocking the annoying popups on Bunkr, that isn't blocked by Brave on mobile, but it also includes some other visual stuff/advertisement/annoyance blocks - both for Bunkr and for some other NSFW sites.
It'll likely be broken within a week since the last update, as Bunkr updates its popup domains pretty often.
